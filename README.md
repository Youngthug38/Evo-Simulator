# Evo-Simulator
An advanced pokedex evolution simulator 
üëæ Evo-Simulator: A Pok√©mon Evolution Simulator üëæ
An interactive, retro-themed web application that allows users to simulate the evolution of any Pok√©mon under various conditions. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and powered by the public Pok√©API.

(You can replace the placeholder above by taking a screenshot of the app and uploading it to your repository!)

‚ú® Features
The Evo-Simulator is more than just a Pokedex‚Äîit's an interactive "what-if" machine for Pok√©mon fans.

Interactive Simulation: See a Pok√©mon's evolution options appear as dynamic buttons and click to evolve them step-by-step.

Complete Pok√©mon Databank: A searchable list of all 1000+ Pok√©mon makes it easy to find any creature, regardless of its name in different languages.

Global Condition Toggles:

Day/Night Cycle: Switch between Day and Night modes to see how it affects Pok√©mon like Eevee, complete with a full thematic UI change.

Mega Evolutions: Toggle Mega Evolutions on or off to control the rules of your simulation.

Dual Theming: Choose between a classic Pok√©mon Red or Pok√©mon Blue theme for the UI accents.

Live Animations: A dynamic background of floating Pok√©balls and an interactive, glowing home screen make the app feel alive.

Canon-Accurate Data: All evolution methods, including item usage, friendship levels, trade conditions, and special moves, are accurately represented.

üí° About This Project
The Evo-Simulator was created as a fun, educational project to merge a passion for Pok√©mon with a love for coding. It's designed to be a showcase of what can be built with core web technologies and a great API, and to inspire others to start their own coding journeys.
